# Map-Coloring-Problem
This application solves the map coloring problem using recursive backtracking

This code reads a txt file to form a graph.
A sample graph.txt file has been kept for your reference in the repository.
The first line is to specify if the graph will be directed or undirected.
Then in the next line will be the number of vertices.
Then in each new line will be the name of the vertices.
Then in the following lines will be the edges.

This code will convert this graph into an adjacency matrix data structure.
This graph.txt file can be places anywhere but the path of the file will have to be changed in the code accordingly.

Also the minimum number of colours you want will be stored in the variable 'number_of_colours' in main function.
You can change this accordingly as per your choice.
And then run the file MapColoringProblem.java as a java application.

And this code will print whether the solution is feasible or not !
